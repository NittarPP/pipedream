# Overview

The Twenty API allows developers to interact programmatically with the Twenty platform, which is designed to help users organize events and social gatherings. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate event management, engage attendees more efficiently, and synchronize event data with other services like calendars, communication tools, and CRM systems. The API provides endpoints for creating and managing events, handling invitations, and managing user interactions, making it a powerful tool for enhancing the event experience both before and after the actual date.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Event Creation and Calendar Syncing**: When a new event is created in your custom company dashboard, automatically create the same event in Twenty via the API. Then, use the Google Calendar API to add this event to your company's main calendar, ensuring everyone is informed and reducing manual calendar entries.

- **RSVP Tracking to CRM**: Once an attendee RSVPs to a Twenty event, automatically capture their details and response status and update your CRM system, like Salesforce. This can help in tailoring communication and follow-up strategies for each attendee based on their interests and engagement level.

- **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: After an event concludes, trigger an automated email to all attendees using the SendGrid API to request feedback. Collect responses and store them in a Google Sheet for easy analysis and future planning. This ensures timely feedback while the event is still fresh in attendees' minds.
